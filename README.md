# wa2html
A Python script to import WhatsApp message exports with image file names, and output an webpage with the images embedded.

Work in progress!
To do:
Take the input .txt file as an argument instead of hardcoding in the script
Add the image file link so you can click and view the full size image
Auto scaling of images to a reasonable resolution for a webpage
Make the browser do the work to render the page with CSS instead of basic HTML img src
